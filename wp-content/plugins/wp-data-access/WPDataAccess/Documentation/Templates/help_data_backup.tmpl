  <li>Data backup files can be written to a local folder or a Dropbox folder</li>

  <li>Exported SQL files can be imported into a  WordPress database with a different table prefix.
      The WordPress table prefix is replaced during export by variable {wp_prefix}, which is replaced by the WordPress table prefix on import.
      If you want to use another tool for import, disable checkbox "Export with variable WP prefix" in Back-End Settings on the Manage Plugin page.
      With "Export with variable WP prefix" disabled full table names will be written to the export file.</li>

## Documentation
Documentation was moved to the plugin and can now be accessed directly from the plugins menu (WP Data Access > Plugin Help).

Developers who are interested in using the plugins PHP classes can generate the API documentation as follows:
1) Start your command line interface
2) Move to the plugins root directory
3) Enter: composer update (this will install phpdocumentor and all its necessary dependencies)
4) Enter: php vendor/phpdocumentor/phpdocumentor/bin/phpdoc.php (this will generate the plugins API documentation in subfolder named docs)
5) Move to the docs subfolder and open the file index.html in your browser

## Notes
* The documentation is currently not up to date. Sorry! I have to get to that. I just like programming more... ;-)

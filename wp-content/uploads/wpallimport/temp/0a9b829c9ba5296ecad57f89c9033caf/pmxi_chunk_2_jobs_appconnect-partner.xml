Its success has grown rapidly in its two years of operation and we can now continue to offer this wonderful program to US certified middle and high school science teachers who specialise in physics, chemistry or biology.</p> <p>Teaching in England is a wonderful and unique opportunity and we are recruiting all year round with our next focus on September 2019.</p> <p>To teach science in the UK, not only will you have the long term opportunity to teach in England, you’ll receive outstanding subject-specific CPD, ongoing support from a school based mentor and gain an in-depth knowledge and understanding of current science pedagogy.</p> <p> </p> <p>As a science teacher teaching in England you’ll also be provided with full support during the relocation phase and visa process and will be matched with a suitable secondary school in the south-east England region. This includes teaching in London.</p> <p> </p> <p><u>What do our current science teachers think of the program?</u></p> <h3>Kayleigh</h3> <p>‘I would definitely recommend Quantum Scholars to anyone looking to teach in England. The entire experience has been great and I am really enjoying teaching in the UK. The school I work in has been a great fit for me and my personality as well as my experiences in the USA.’</p> <h3>Alex</h3> <p>‘They are prompt, effective communicators that are eager to support you through the process. They are extremely supportive and informative and make an intimidating process seem easy. It is a great program where the representatives are excited to help you with the transition.’</p> <h3>Amy</h3> <p>‘The advice I received when making a decision to accept my position was extremely honest and helpful. The process to secure a position to teach in the UK was made so much easier by working with Quantum Scholars.

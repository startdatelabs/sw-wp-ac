Believe the world needs innovators? Ready to have a career-defining summer? Have a love for art, science, technology, team-building or education?</p> <p> </p> <p>Lead Instructors are the staff most well-placed to bring innovation to life at Galileo. We believe that our approach to learning isn’t merely a pedagogy—it is a tool that will help shape the worldview of future innovators. Lead Instructors interact with their curriculum—planning ahead, reflecting daily and viewing improvements as opportunities. Lead Instructors bring to life Galileo's curriculum, thoughtfully created by our year-round curriculum design team. They are our ultimate partner in consistently looking for new ways to bring the Galileo Innovation Approach to our campers.</p> <p> </p> <p>We value having divergent thinkers who bring various experiences and viewpoints to the table at Galileo. We strongly encourage members of underrepresented groups to apply.</p> <p> </p> <p><em><strong>ABOUT GALILEO</strong></em>Galileo’s mission is to develop innovators who envision and create a better world. We know it’s bold. We also know that we can’t achieve it without asking staff to be role models of an innovator’s mindset—visionary, courageous, collaborative, determined and reflective. It’s not always easy. Camp staffers work hard. Very hard. You can expect days in which there’s a ton to get done and not a ton of time to do it. But part of what makes our culture great is that no one is too proud to complete any task that needs doing. Our camp staffers bring camp magic to life—for campers, and for themselves.</p> <p>This isn’t your average summer recreation gig. Galileans are expected to take ownership of their own performance and make this place better every day. People with a can-do attitude thrive here and those with a victim mentality don't. We manage to keep this level of performance expectation high in a relaxed environment; we take our work, but not ourselves, seriously.</p> <p>Being a Galilean means jumping into action to bring camp magic to life. Depending on the day, that could mean donning a tutu for a skit, creating a gorgeous sign that highlights the Galileo Innovation Approach, or playing a board game with two campers to build connection. You’ve got to know what it means to be a vital part of a team. You’ve got to want to grow. You’ve got to like to have fun at work. You have to smile—a lot—and you have to like to laugh. After all, we run summer camps. You get the point.</p> <h2>Position Description</h2> <p><em><strong>SHARED VALUES AND EXPECTATIONS</strong></em>• Serve as an ambassador of Galileo, demonstrating our mission and values in a positive and professional manner and acting as a role model of the Galileo Innovator’s Mindset• Commit to building a safe, child-focused community• Demonstrate professionalism and accountability• Take initiative to analyze and solve problems• Treat others with courtesy and respect• Respond to camper, family member and colleague needs• Strengthen our relationship with host site by upholding facility policies and embracing host site employees as partners• Maintain a high standard of ethics, integrity and confidentiality</p> <p><em><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></em>• Commitment to educational programming for children• Flexibility to meet changing work needs and demands• Ability to work collaboratively on a high-functioning team• Openness to feedback and desire to grow professionally• Ability to handle multiple tasks efficiently and accurately• Strong organization skills and attention to detail• Ability to communicate clearly, maturely and compassionately with families• Ability to maintain an excellent work ethic, a high level of energy and exceptional enthusiasm all day, every day, for the duration of the summer</p> <p><em><strong>EXPERIENCE & EDUCATION</strong></em>• College graduate or equivalent experience• Preferred experience with the grade level you will be teaching• Preferred experience with the subject you will be teaching• Experience working with kids or in a camp setting a plus</p> <p><em><strong>ESSENTIAL DUTIES & RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></em>• For Camp Galileo Lead Instructors (K-5th grade): Read and learn curriculum for your subject prior to the start of camp.
